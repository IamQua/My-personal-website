    The chapters of my life vary greatly yet each one has its own flavor and vibe.  Each molding my spirit and soul into the human I am today for which I have no regrets, for it is all a part of my story unfolding. </p>

    <p>~ Leading 68% of a Ralph Lauren outlet from $68.2m to $81.2m in profits over one single year by coaching and inspiring staff to want to grow. </p>
   <p> ~ Throwing VERY fun and profitable events nestled deep in the nightlife of the LES of NYC all being supplemental branch offs from my home base bar Cocktail Bodega. </p> 
    <p>~ Growing millions of dollars worth of legal cannabis yield and experiencing all the amazing beautiful views and vast glory of NorCal nature. </p>
    <p>~ Leading, teaching, coaching, and supporting other humans to reach their potentials over my whole journey throughout it all. </p>

  <ul style="text-align: center;">

  <p class="bottomt">              After turning the page onto a new chapter towards a new industry and lifestyle due to the flooded industry of legal cannabis cultivation, it seemed as if I had just stumbled down off the mountains and farms of deep NorCal into a new world.
   </p> <br>
  <p class="bottomt">              Feeling like a Rip Van Wrinkle after about a decade in what felt like another world, the truth of my observations was apparent.  Technology, AI, Digitalism, Web3, Decentralization, Computer Science, and so forth had evolved and so had the humans that use it.
   </p> <br>
  <p class="bottomt">              It became very clear to me very quickly that this is our future. Our children, our culture, oru lives as we know it are all shifting very quickly into a new realm. 
  </p> <br>
  <p class="bottomt">              It is up to us to steer this in the right direction my friends.  We are the ones in the process of creating and birthing intelligence and we MUST all collectively take part in making sure we do it right.   
  </p> <br>
  <p class="bottomt">              My friends we have but ONE chance to do this with acute precision. Within this tech space of AI, robotics, bio-tech, etc.; the "future" is approaching rapidly and we are at the fore front of a new humanity...a revolution. </p> <br>
    <p class="bottomt">  THIS is why I am here.  To be a part of the shift.  To do my part in steering us on a healthy path the best I can alongside my fellow humans as a collective species.
